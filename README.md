# Macro Challenge
Our final challenge whilst part of Apple Developer Academy | Mackenzie.

## Solution Description
A platform meant to organize and centralize educational documents where the user acts by creating, editing, sharing and uploading documents.

While editing a document the user will have these set of interactions:
* Add, move, resize and write in text fields (similar to WhatsApp)
  * The user may choose a picture and select an area in which the app will analyze with Vision and CoreML to turn the selected area into text
* Add, move and resize images

Once the user has saved version of the document, he may choose to share it via CloudKit sharing(similar to iOS Collaborate), in which he'll have control over the guests permissions to the file(read only/read and write).
